Before launching Cod4StatsReader, it is important that the database with which you wish to store the stats in is a registered data source.  Also, the database must contain fields entitled: Player, Kills, Deaths, Kill/Death Ratio, Kill Streak, Suicides headshots, and a field for every weapon in the game.  These fields can be in any order, and if a weapon is missed out (or a new one is added to the game) then it will be detected by Cod4StatsReader and a popup will notify you on which field to add to the database.  All the fields have data type integer except for Player, which is text, and Kill/Death Ratio, which is double.  A blank database should be supplied with Cod4StatsReader so you will only have to worry about the second part of this readme document.
To register your database as a data source open control panel and click "Administritive tools".  Then click ODBC (Data Sources) and press add and select the microsoft access driver.  Then give your data source a name and press the select button to find your database before pressing OK.  Your database should now be a registered data source.  When Cod4StatsReader asks for the name of your database simply type: jdbc:odbc:<the name you gave to the data source>
